#View Time In 15 Minute Segments

Sometimes, when you are doing a workout with a club, or team, you don't want to be looking at your watch every 30 seconds. This data field is designed to discourage looking at your watch too much, by providing enough info that you need to be informed, but not get too specific.

It shows the elapsed time of the workout, but it always rounds down to the nearest 15 minutes. This encourages you to check the time way less often, as it will likely have not changed. I use this technique all of the time, as it allows you to focus on your training.
